The Arsenal Gear Population Synthesis Code
==========================================
Welcome to the documentation for the arsenal_gear population synthesis code.
Arsenal is designed to generate feedback inputs for simulations of star
and galaxy formation.  It allows you to draw from a wide range of stellar
evolution and star formation models to sample the breadth of currently explored
parameter space of the physics that determines the mass, metals, and energies
deposited by a population of stars into the surrounding ISM.

This code has been a collaborative effort on the parts of Benjamin Keller,
Lachlan Lancaster, Eric Andersson, Zachary Wyatt, and Claude
Cournoyer-Cloutier.
