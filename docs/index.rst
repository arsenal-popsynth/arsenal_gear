==========================================
The Arsenal Gear Population Synthesis Code
==========================================
Welcome to the documentation for the arsenal_gear population synthesis code.
Arsenal is designed to generate feedback inputs for simulations of star
and galaxy formation.  It allows you to draw from a wide range of stellar
evolution and star formation models to sample the breadth of currently explored
parameter space of the physics that determines the mass, metals, and energies
deposited by a population of stars into the surrounding ISM. 

This code has been a collaborative effort on the parts of Eric Andersson,
Claude Cournoyer-Cloutier, Ben Keller, Lachlan Lancaster, Marta Reina-Campos,
James Wadsley, and Zachary Wyatt.
